They are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the platform and use its features. If you remove or disable these cookies,
 we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use our platform.</span></p> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">We use the following types of cookies in our platform:</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Essential Cookies</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">We use essential cookies to make our platform work. These cookies are strictly necessary to enable core functionality such as security,
 network management,
 your cookie preferences and accessibility. Without them you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the Websites function.
            <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our platform but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the platform as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously.
            </span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Marketing Cookies</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">These account-based marketing cookies enable us to identify future prospects and personalize sales and marketing interactions with them.
