We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">By submitting your email address on this website,
 you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them,
 either directly,
 or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails,
 because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address,
 you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook,
 where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If,
 however,
 you have provided the same email to us through another method,
 we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails,
 we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">We are incorporated in India. Information collected via our website,
 through direct interactions with you,
 or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel,
 or to third parties,
 located throughout the world,
 and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world,
 including countries
              that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law,
 by using any of the above,
 you voluntarily consent to the trans- border transfer and hosting of such information.</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Is the information collected through our service secure?</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical,
 electronic,
 and managerial procedures to help safeguard,
 prevent unauthorized access,
 maintain data security,
 and correctly use your information. However,
 neither people nor security systems are foolproof,
 including encryption systems. In addition,
 people can commit intentional crimes,
 make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore,
 while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information,
 we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information,
 you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <h3>Can I update or correct my information?</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.
              Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information,
 (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us,
 or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph),
 by cancelling your account. Such updates,
 corrections,
 changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain,
 or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update,
 correction,
 change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security,
 we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
              You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request,
 all personal information stored in databases we actively use,
 and other readily searchable media will be updated,
 corrected,
 changed or
              deleted,
 as appropriate,
 as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.
              If you are an end user and wish to update,
 delete,
 or receive any information we have about you,
 you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</span></p> <p class="p3"><br></p> <!----> <!----> <!----> <h3>Sale of Business</h3> <p class="p10"><span class="s1">We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale,
