          <h2>Commonly used treatments for COVID-19 and therapies with emergency use authorizations (EUAs)</h2>
          <p>During a public health emergency, such as COVID-19, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) to help make new medications and medical products more available to patients. Having an EUA does not mean that the FDA has approved the medication or product. Rather, the intent of an EUA is to make it easier for patients to receive a new potential treatment when no other options are available.</p>

              <p>On March 24, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) application for the use of convalescent plasma to treat people with COVID-19. Plasma is the liquid part of blood that carries blood cells. Convalescent plasma is collected from people who have recovered from COVID-19. It is then transfused into someone with an active coronavirus infection.</p>

              <p>Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to help fight infections. They bind to foreign pathogens, like viruses, and help destroy them. Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are antibodies made in a lab. It can take the body weeks to develop natural antibodies, so using MABs can potentially fight off infections sooner.</p>

In a press release, Regeneron reported that REGN-COV2 reduced viral load and relieved symptoms sooner in patients with COVID-19 who were not hospitalized.</p>

            <p>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are two medications that have been used for many decades to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A few small studies initially suggested that they may also be helpful for treating hospitalized patients with mild cases of COVID-19, though the current consensus from national health institutions (such as the FDA) is that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine do not work for preventing or treating COVID-19.</p>

It has been shown to have some in vitro activity against viruses like influenza A and Zika, but did not work against the coronavirus that causes MERS. </p>

            <p>Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (Both are inflammatory diseases.) It works by blocking interleukin-6 (IL-6), a protein involved in our natural immune responses. IL-6 is a cytokine (signaling protein) that normally alerts other cells to activate the immune system, but too much activation can cause issues.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Kinase inhibitors</a></h4>
            <p>Kinase inhibitors are similar to IL-6 inhibitors in that they also affect the body’s immune response. Because they can block cytokine signaling pathways, it is believed that they may have a potential role in helping with cytokine storms. Some may also have antiviral activity. Many kinase inhibitors are used as cancer treatments, but some are approved for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Interferons</a></h4>
            <p>Interferons are signaling proteins (cytokines) that tell the body a virus is present and to ramp up defenses. In vitro studies have shown that interferon-alfa (IFN-α) and interferon-beta (IFN-β) have antiviral activity against the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Small studies have looked at interferon in combination with other therapies for COVID-19 but results have been mixed and difficult to interpret due to the low quality of the studies. Overall, more data is needed.</p>

            <p>Kaletra is an HIV medication containing a combination of two antivirals called lopinavir and ritonavir. In vitro and clinical studies looking at patients who had previously received these antiviral agents suggest that they may have some activity against SARS and MERS (infections caused by other coronaviruses). Data for using Kaletra in COVID-19 is limited.</p>

          <p>Ivermectin is an oral medication used to treat infections caused by parasites. It is also available as a lotion or cream to treat lice and rosacea. An in vitro study found that ivermectin can stop SARS-CoV-2 from replicating. Other small studies have also been done, including a retrospective study that looked at the medical charts of 280 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Florida between March and May 2020. Patients who got ivermectin had a lower death rate than those who did not (13% vs. 25%).</p>
